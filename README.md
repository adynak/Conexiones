# ConnectionZ

ConnectionZ is a cross-platform (iOS, macOS) app written in SwiftUI that acts as an 
alternative frontend for the [NYT game Connections](https://nytimes.com/games/connections). 
ConnectionZ aims to provide a richer gameplay experience, mostly based around the UI 
paradigm of dragging tiles around to plan your solution. 

## Why the name?

It started out as "DraggableConnections", then it became "Dragon Ball ConnectionZ", or ConnectionZ for short.
